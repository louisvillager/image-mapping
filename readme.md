# Image Mapping
## by Marc Rivers
---
This project is designed to learn HTML image mapping. It consists of one HTML page, with one stylesheet and one JavaScript file.

### Function
There are two aspects of functionality to the page:

- Language Selector
- Color Wheel

The Language Selector defaults to American spellings, but offers an alternative for the benefit of our friends throughout the Commonwealth.
The Color Wheel displays a short spectrum of colors in the display box beneath it. When a color is selected, that color appears in the middle of the spectrum with its adjacent colors at either end.

### Training Focus:
- HTML image mapping
- JavaScript DOM manipulation (CSS styles)
